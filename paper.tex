\section{Introduction}
Of the exoplanets so far discovered, more than \numt\ are known to
transit their host star. These planets, with their favorable orbital
alignment, reveal planetary radii, stellar radii and average
density. Even more information about their orbit can be gleaned from
the exact epoch at which they transit their host star. So called
transit timing variation (TTV) measurements
\citep{2005MNRAS.359..567A} (and cite more?) are designed to reveal
deviations from Keplerian elliptical motion due to the tug other
planets and satellites.

Previous transit timing has been done with optical and infrared
telescopes \citep{2004ApJ...613L.153A,2010A&A...510A.107M} (\&
add some more TTV papers?) The light curves of these transits are smooth
and therefore the exact time at which egress begins or ingress ends is
difficult to pin down precisely. Part of the reason for the curve's
smoothness is limb darkening of the star: due to the temperature
structure of the star, which decreases in temperature with radius,
shallower radial components in the line of sight will appear
darker.

% At the limb, where the shallowest radial component is seen,
%the photosphere is (??? K), whereas a straight line of sight goes to a
%deeper radial component and is (??? K).

In this paper, we outline a method of observing that has the opposite
effect: stars are limb brightened for some wavelengths. In
particular, any optically thin chromospheric or coronal emission line will be
brighter at the limb than in the center. Just as with a planetary
nebula, like the Ring Nebula, the limb of an optically thin shell of
gas is brighter at the edges. This is because the column density at
the limb is much larger at the limb than in the center. This effect is
different from limb darkening, which requires an optically thick
medium and decreasing temperatures with radius.

\citet{assef} point out that limb brightening could be
very useful for detection of transits of giant planets. One advantage
to photometry in limb brightened wavelengths is that transits are
deeper overall than for both limb brightened and uniform disk
emission. This is because the planet cover a larger amount of the
emission. \citet{assef} approximate the limb brightened
star as a uniform ring of emission. With their approximation, the maximum depth
of the transit=$(2\pi R_p/ (2\pi R_*))$ instead of the $(R_p/R_*)^2$
as expected for a uniform disk.

A better approximation for the transit depth is the area of the
projected planet shadow $A_t$, divided by the total area of the
hemisphere, $2\pi R_*^2$. This is in the limit of a geometrically thin
hemisphere of emission, ie. the scale-height of the chromosphere, $h$,
is much smaller than the size of the planet and star, $R_p, R_*$.

%to the total area of the
%curved stellar surface. If the scale-height of the chromosphere, $h$,
%is much smaller than the size of the planet and star, $R_p, R_*$, then
%we can treat the chromosphere as a geometrically thin hemisphere of
%emission.  
%This limit has the problem that at the edge of the shell,
%the surface brightness will be infinite; this is an example classic
%fold-caustic.  However, when one integrates the surface brightness
%over area, the total flux is finite, and thus this still proves to be
%a useful approximation.

%However, rather than integrating over surface brightness to compute
%the transit depth, 
%the depth of transit is simply the area of the 
%hemisphere that is blocked by the planet, 

We can estimate this maximum depth of transit as follows from
Figure \ref{fig01}.  When the planet touches the edge of the star 
(second contact), as shown from an edge-on viewpoint in this figure,
then the length of the arc of the long axis of the shadow is
$R_*\theta$.  Now, the diameter of the planet is given by 
$2 R_p \approx R_*(1-\cos{\theta}) \approx \frac{1}{2} R_* \theta^2$,
where the latter approximation is valid for $\theta \ll 1$.
Solving for $\theta$, we find $\theta = 2\sqrt{R_p/R_*}$, so to
be valid we require $R_p/R_* \ll 1/4$.  Now, we can approximate
the shadow as an ellipse which will have a minor axis of $R_p$
and a major axis of $R_*\theta$, so we can approximate the
area of the shadow as $A_t = \pi \sqrt{R_pR_*} R_p$.  Thus,
the maximum depth of transit is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{depth_anal}
{A_t \over \pi R_*^2} = \frac{1}{2} \left({R_p \over R_*}\right)^{3/2}.
\end{equation}
Note that this is a different scaling than that given in \citet{assef} who did not consider the fold-caustic nature of a chromospheric
transits.

This has the remarkable consequence that the depth of a chromospheric
transit does not decline as much with the radius of the planet as 
a transit of a uniform disk.  A chromospheric transit has a maximum
depth that is $\frac{1}{2} \left({R_* \over R_p}\right)^{1/2}$
times deeper than the maximum transit depth of a uniform disk;
thus smaller planets have an advantage to be observed at
chromospheric wavelengths, as emphasized by \citet{assef}.

In $\mathsection$\ref{labl:chromlcurve} we calculate the expected limb
brightened light curve for an optically thin emission line and compare
this to UV images of the Sun. In $\mathsection$\ref{labl:stactv}, we
discuss the effects of stellar activity on these observations. We
compare the expected transit timing precision for UV photometry with
optical photometry in $\mathsection$\ref{labl:sn} and list targets
suitable for UV photometry in $\mathsection$\ref{labl:targ}. We
also outline several possibilities for chromospheric science in
$\mathsection$\ref{labl:cscience}.


\section{Limb Brightening}
\label{labl:limbbright}
\subsection{Limb Brightened Lines}
-\\
Optically thin lines are the most limb-brightened
-\\
-\\
For M Stars in the Near UV, we'd be looking at 
-\\
- FeII, SiII lines from 2300 \AA\  to 2775 \AA\ 
-\\
- Don't include the optically thick MgII h and k lines at
$\sim$2800 \AA\ \citep{2007PASP..119...67H}
-\\
-\\

\subsection{Chromospheric Light-Curve: Thin-Shell Approximation} \label{labl:chromlcurve}

-\\
For optically thin chromospheric lines:
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\mathrm{LB}} = {A_t \over \pi R_*^2} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left( R_p/R_* \right)^{3/2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\mathrm{UD}} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{\mathrm{LB}}$ is the limb brightened transit depth and
$\delta_{\mathrm{UD}}$ is the uniform disk transit depth \\
 -\\
 - Eric's figure: projection of planet shadow onto curved surface
 -\\ - \\

\subsection{Dependence on Planet Size}
-Chromospheric transit depths are deeper for the same size planet \\
-Chromospheric transit  depths for small planets are closer to the depths for large planets
 - Eric's figure: limb-brightened vs. uniform-disk egresses for two different size planets \\
-Chromospheric transits allow you to look for transits of giant stars \\


\subsection{Isothermal Chromospheric Models}
- \\
- We use the coronal approximation (optical thinness of chromosphere)
- Eric's figure of a limb-brightened star \\
 - we assume an opaque photosphere which creates a discontinuity \\
- A more accurate prediction can made with an exponential emissivity \\
--- When the scale height is larger than the planet, it's a smoother, longer-lived transit \\
--- When the scale height is smaller than the planet, it gets sharper, but starts loosing flux when we can't see the emission from the far side \\


\subsection{Comparison to SOHO data}
-\\
- Compare our models to light curves from SOHO FeIX images
 (or light curves from STEREO observing the moon crossing the sun) \\
- explain discrepancies\\
- discuss differences between M-dwarf or giant chromospheric transit
vs. a sun-like chromospheric transit \\

\section{The Effects of Stellar Activity}\label{labl:stactv}
-\\
-    Starspots - are they a problem? \\
-\\
-    Compare Transit lifetime to flare lifetimes
-  Select and list more quiescent stars that would be good candidates

\section{Signal to Noise Calculations} \label{labl:sn}
- What does the NUV flux and (R$_p$/R$_*$) have to be to make this feasible?

\section{Targets for UV Observations} \label{labl:targ}
- I think this is going to be M-dwarfs and giants \\
- stars where our method beats conventional photometry
-      Report GALEX fluxes \\
-   Possible telescopes - Swift, Hubble or GALEX \\

\subsection{Chromospheric Science} \label{labl:cscience}
- \\
- In addition to UV transit timing, we could also study chromospheres
- \\
- We can map out spots and even see how they might migrate as done by \citet{2010arXiv1002.4113H}
